in 2010 alone we will generate 1,200 exabytes—60 million times the content of the Library of Congress
you don't go to the zoo to see Chihuahuas and raccoons; you go to admire the majestic polar bear, the graceful zebra, and the terrifying Sumatran tiger.
visualizations share a common "DNA"—a set of mappings between data properties and visual attributes such as position, size, shape, and color
Analysts often want to fit their data to statistical models, either to test hypotheses or predict future values, but an improper choice of model can lead to faulty predictions.
Parallel Coordinates
Each poly-line represents a single row in the database, and line crossings between dimensions often indicate inverse correlation.
Enclosure Diagrams
by packing circles instead of subdividing rectangles, we can produce a different sort of enclosure diagram that has an almost organic appearance.
Networks
node-link diagrams are also used to visualize networks, but the loss of hierarchy means a different algorithm is required to position nodes
Arc Diagrams
with a good ordering of nodes it is easy to identify cliques and bridges.
bioinformatics and text visualization are driving researchers and designers to continually formulate new and creative representations or find more powerful ways to apply the classics.
